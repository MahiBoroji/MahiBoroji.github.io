## Robotic Research
* ## Motion Planning for Object Manipulation by Edge-Rolling
A common way to manipulate heavy objects is to maintain at least one point of the object in contact with the environment during the manipulation. When the object has a cylindrical shape or, in general, a curved edge, not only sliding and pivoting motions but also rolling the object along the edge can effectively satisfy this condition. Edge-rolling offers several advantages in terms of efficiency and maneuverability. This paper aims to develop a novel approach for approximating the prehensile edge-rolling motion on any path by a sequence of constant screw displacements, leveraging the principles of screw theory. Based on this approach, we proposed an algorithmic method for task-space-based path generation of object manipulation between two given configurations using a sequence of rolling and pivoting motions. The method is based on an optimization algorithm that takes into account the joint limitations of the robot. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments to manipulate a cylinder along linear and curved paths using the Franka Emika Panda manipulator.

## Engineering-Medicine Research
* ## Ex-vivo Raman spectroscopy and AI-based classification of soft tissue sarcomas
This research demonstrates how combining Raman spectroscopy—a tool that reveals the biochemical fingerprint of tissues—with AI can accurately distinguish between different types of soft tissue sarcomas and normal tissues. By scanning tissue samples from seven patients and collecting thousands of Raman spectra, a custom AI model (ResNet) was trained to classify eight tissue types, achieving an overall accuracy of 97.1%. This method provides an efficient, fast, and non-invasive alternative to traditional margin-assessment techniques, which are often slow and prone to errors.
