Academic Projects
======
* Crazyflie Project:
  * Developed an advanced autonomous flight system for Crazyflie drones featuring obstacle avoidance, dynamic path planning (using D* lite), and precision landing capabilities.[[report]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xa3mldBdaXYvfkTTv_e3aqU2L0KCLq8pDLhZfHjOtOo/edit?usp=sharing)[[GitHub]](https://github.com/VahidDanesh/cfpilot)
* pandaSim Project:
  * Developed a complete manipulation pipeline in Genesis, a physics-based simulator, integrating geometry extraction, screw motion planning, and resolved-rate motion control modules. Introduced an additional finger-level degree of freedom to enhance dexterity and manipulability, achieving 96% success in object reorientation using the Franka Emika Panda robot.
